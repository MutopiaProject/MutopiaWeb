<h2>How to contribute to Mutopia</h2>

<p>Obviously without all the people contributing music to Mutopia, it wouldn't exist! If you would like to help the world of music by entering some of history's great music, then here's how.</p>

<p>We only accept music typeset using <a href="http://lilypond.org">LilyPond</a>. However, if you use other typesetting software which can export in MusicXML format, then you should be able to import the music into LilyPond. See <a href="http://lilypond.org/web/documentation">the LilyPond documentation</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Check Projects in Progress</h3>

<p>It's a good idea to check the archive itself and the <a href="projects.html">projects in progress page</a> to make sure that you're not about to enter some music that someone's already entering or has entered.</p>

<h3>Check Copyright Status of Source</h3>

<p>If you are contributing music you have composed yourself, then this section doesn't apply to you. If you are contributing classical music, however, even if it is your own arrangement, then you need to check that the source of the music you're going to enter is out of copyright. For our purposes it has to meet the following criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li>The composer, lyricist, arranger and editor <b>all</b> must have been dead for more than seventy years.</li>
<li>The work must have been published prior to 1923.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, our version of Handel's opera <a href="cgibin/piece-info.cgi?id=119">Giulio Cesare</a> (HWV 17) was edited by Friedrich Chrysander, and the source edition was published in 1875. Handel died in 1759, and Chrysander died in 1901, so this edition is in the public domain. More information about these rules is available on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Domain">Wikipedia Public Domain page</a>.</p>

<p>Incidentally, it is worth remembering that some older editions are heavily edited and can be rather error prone. For all new contributions we insist that you tell us the source you used when transcribing the music. This is to ensure as far as possible that all contributions are from out-of-copyright sources. If you spot any possible copyright violations, please let us know.</p>

<h3>Typeset the Music</h3>

<p>Enter the music using the music typesetting software <a href="http://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a>. It is free in the sense that you don't have to pay for it, and also that the source code is available for you to look at, recompile and even improve. It is available for both Unix-like operating systems (eg. Linux) as well as Mac OS X and Windows. If you need help installing LilyPond then we recommend you subscribe to one or more of the mailing lists dedicated to it - more information is on the LilyPond web pages. If you have already entered music in another free typesetting program then it may be possible to convert it into LilyPond format. Check LilyPond's documentation for more information.</p>

<p>Decide what terms you want to release the music under. The three possibilities are described on the <a href="legal.html">license details page</a>. By submitting music to Mutopia, you are declaring that you have the legal right to release the work under the terms chosen.</p>

<h3>Add Mutopia Headers</h3>

<p>When you are satisfied that the music is fully entered and looks good, you are ready to add the extra few finishing touches needed for Mutopia. These are detailed on the rest of this page.</p>

<h3>Send us the Music</h3>

<p>If all this seems a little complicated then please don't be put off - it's not really that hard! We're looking forward to receiving your contribution to the world of free music for all. Contributions should be sent, by e-mail, to &lt;<b>contributions (at) MutopiaProject.org</b>&gt;.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to refuse files submitted to Mutopia if we feel that they are in any way unsuitable.</p>

[[ BREAK() ]]

<p>Firstly, <i>please</i> check that the file compiles cleanly with LilyPond at both Letter and A4 paper sizes. Please consider the users of the music - don't pick a very small font size unless it is necessary, and try to avoid "widowed" lines of music on the last page, and nasty page turns, if possible! If there are any serious problems with the file, we will probably ask you to fix them and resubmit.</p>

<p>The LilyPond <i>version</i> should be defined in the .ly file, using the <code>\version</code> statement.</p>

<p>You next need to ensure that the music will generate one or more MIDI files when run through LilyPond. This just means adding a <code>\midi</code> section towards the end of the .ly file; see LilyPond's documentation for more information.</p>

<p>You also need to make sure that your .ly file <i>does not</i> have any papersize settings which will interfere with the commands we'll use to compile the file (see above). The only exception is if your music should be produced in landscape format, eg. for organ music.</p>

<p>Finally, define the following headers in the \header section. These will be used for the title, composer, etc. when the music is displayed on Mutopia. Please make sure they're filled in carefully in the described format, in English.</p>
