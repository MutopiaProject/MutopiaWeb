          <h2>The Mutopia Project: Free sheet music for everyone</h2>
          <h3>Classical and Contemporary Music</h3>

          <p>The Mutopia Project offers sheet music editions of classical music for free download. These are based on editions in the public domain, and include works by Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Handel, Mozart, and many others. A team of volunteers are involved in typesetting the music by computer using the <a href="http://lilypond.org">LilyPond</a> software. Why not join them?! See the <a href="contribute.html">page on how to contribute</a> for more information.</p>

          <p>We also host a growing number of modern editions, arrangements and new music. The respective editors, arrangers and composers have chosen to make these works freely available.</p>

          <hr />

          <h3>Usage of the Music &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/"><img src="images/cc.primary.srr.gif" alt="CC: Some rights reserved" class="noborder" width="88" height="31" /></a></h3>

          <p>All of the music on Mutopia may be freely downloaded, printed, copied, distributed, modified, performed and recorded. Music is supplied as PDF files for easy printing on either A4 or US Letter paper. The LilyPond source files are also available, which allow you to make your own editions based on ours. Computer-generated audio previews of the music are available as MIDI files, to give you a rough idea of what the music sounds like.</p>

          <p>Most of our music is distributed
            under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses. Each piece clearly lists what license it is distributed under. For precise details of what each license permits, see the <a href="legal.html">license details page</a>.</p>
