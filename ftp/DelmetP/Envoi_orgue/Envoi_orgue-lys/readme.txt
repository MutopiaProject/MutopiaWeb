"Envoi de fleurs" is perhaps the most well-known song composed by Paul Delmet.
Both composer and singer, he enjoyed an enormous success in his times. 
Often featured at the celebrated Chat Noir cabaret in Montmartre, this particuliar ambience and era is well 
captured and perfectly reflected in his compositions.  

This organ transcriptions is based on the original version of "Envoi de fleurs", 
published by Enoch & Cie, in 1897. 
There is two versions: 
- the first with the melody at the pedal part. This is simply the original score in the original key signature, 
and the voice part is transposed at the pedal.

- the second with the melody played by the left hand. This version is slightly arranged: the pedal plays 
the bass part, letting the right foot free to use the swell pedal and creating the 'cantabile' expressions. 

I think that this easy work will work fine on romantic/symphonic organs, and can even 
be played during church services at the catholic offertory or at the lutheran organ solo interludes.
