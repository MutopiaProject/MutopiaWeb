<h2>Communication from Dennis Pajot about KV 477:</h2>

<p>Here is a brief summary and explanation of the three (not only two)
versions of the Masonic Funeral Music.  Hope this helps some.  Mozart
entered the Masonic Funeral Music in his work catalogue "in the month
of July [1785]" as "Masonic Funeral Music for the death of Brothers
Meklenburg and Esterhazy".  The problem here is that Georg August von
Mecklenburg-Strelitz died on November 6, 1785, and Franz Esterhazy von
Galatha on November 7, 1785.  Both deaths were observed in ceremony at
the Vienna Crowned Hope Lodge on November 17, 1785.</p>

<p>The theory of Philippe Autexier from the Mozart Jahrbuch of 1984-85
goes like this.  The Masonic Funeral Music is dated in the month of
July and the next entry, the Piano Quartet in g-minor K478 is dated
"ditto" to the Funeral music.  This Quartet is dated October 16, 1785
on its autograph.  The next entry in the work catalogue is the vocal
quartet K479 entered November 5 -- still before the two Masonic
brothers died.  Thus all three of these pieces were entered after the
brothers died -- thus after Nov 7 but before the entry dated November
21, the vocal trio K480.  One other important note here is Mozart
designated the setting for the Masonic funeral music in his work
catalogue for 2 Violins, 2 Violas, 1 Clarinet, 1 Bassetthorn, 2 Oboes,
2 Horns and Basso.  In the autograph the piece calls for 2 more
Bassetthorns and a Contra Bassoon.</p>

<p>Looking for a dating in July for the funeral music, Autexier found a
clue in the Lamentation melody used in the middle of the work.  He
found the symbols of this theme to brought into connection with the
ceremony of elevation to the Master, and a Master whose temple had
been destroyed.  One such case happened precisely in the summer of
1785 in Vienna.  On August 12 Mozart attended the elevation of Carl
von Koenig whose Lodge had been forbidden in May by the Inquisition.
Autexier hypothesised the music played that day was the music we know
as the Funeral Music and was originally wrote for two part Man's choir
and orchestra.  Two texts are preserved in a song collection that
Mozart set to music, on poems of Gottlieb Leon, on this date also.
The texts begin with words "In dunkle Schatten eingehulltet" and
"Vollbracht ist die Arbeit der Meister".</p>

<p>When the two Masonic brother died, Mozart re-scored this music used
for the elevation ceremony for funeral music -- in the setting stated
in his work catalogue.  Then on December 7, 1785, a second Lodge
funeral was given to honor Mecklenburg and the expanded setting was
used for this.</p>

<p>In short Autexier proposed three versions of the music;</p>

<ol>
<li>On August 12, 1785, in Vienna Masonic lodge (2 male chorus) for elevation of Carl von Koenig (with 2 songs on text of Leon).</li>
<li>November 17, 1785, rescored (without voices) for funeral music.</li>
<li>December 7, 1785, again for funeral music (with expanded setting).</li>
</ol>

<p>Two studies have been made since then -- by Heinz Schuler (1992) and
Jason B. Grant (2000) suggesting meanings in the music and exactly
where played in the Masonic ritual, but I have not read either, so can
not comment on them.</p>
