<h2>Communication from Andrea Hubrich about KV 477:</h2>

<p>Greetings Maurizio.</p>

<p>This is one of my favorite Masonic works by Mozart.  Here is some info
I have on this piece and I hope it'll help.</p>

<p>From "Mozart and the Masons" by H.C. Robbins Landon:</p>

<blockquote>
    "Mozart's most important piece of Masonic music hitherto had
    originated in the deaths, within a day of each other in 1785, of
    two Brothers: Georg August, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (d. 6
    Nov.), and Franz, Count Esterhazy of Galantha (d. 7 Nov.).  In the
    Vienna Lodge ‘Zur gekroenten Hoffnung’ on 17 Nov. was held a Lodge
    of Sorrows.  Wenzel Tobias Epstein delievered the Oration, while
    Mozart, with a collection of musicians, some of them Brethren,
    produced his Maurerische Trauermusik (K.477).  This Masonic
    Funeral Music, with its heavy symbolism (concept of three), also
    in its overall form (in the middle B part there appears an old
    Gregorian chant, part of the music for Passion week), reveals
    Mozart's total involment with the theories and philosophies of
    death and their symbolic relationship to the First Degree of the
    Craft."
</blockquote>

<p>From Dr. B. Paumgartner:</p>

<blockquote>
    "The Masonic Funeral Music holds a place all its own among Mozart's
    works, not only for its form and homogeneity, for the ingenious
    choice of the instruments and their exquisite technical treatment,
    but also through the unique grouping of a solemn march around the
    fundamental element of a gregorian chorale.  Mozart very
    accurately penned the Cantus Firmus on a separate leaf in order to
    avoid errors in the elaboration.  According to Heimsoeth the first
    five bars of this melody (bar 25-29) are identical with the first
    Psalm tone with the first Difference after the Cologne
    Antiphonary.  What follows is a local compilation of several Psalm
    tones for the ‘Miserere mei Deus’ -- a Penitential psalm such as
    is frequently used for funerals in several places."
</blockquote>

<p>From "Mozart and Masonry" by Paul Nettl:<p>

<blockquote>
    "Masonic music can be devided into three classes.  The first
    consists of various songs and instrumental pieces which were
    composed for use at lodge meetings, dinners and other occasions.
    The second category comprises music which was not originally
    intended for Masonic occasions, but whose contents made it
    appropriate for such use.  The third and highest group includes
    compositions which are intended to express the Masonic creed but
    are not for use in ceremonies."
