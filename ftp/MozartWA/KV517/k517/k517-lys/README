Die Alte
(The old lady)
==================================================================

This Lied was composed by Mozart in 1787, the year of Don Giovanni and
Eine Kleine Nachtmusick, but also the great year of Lieder.  It is a
sort of "musical joke": an old lady mourns the old days of her youth,
when things went better.  The musical style too tries to evoke those
"old days", as the chords in the piano part recall an old-fashoned
harpsichord.
