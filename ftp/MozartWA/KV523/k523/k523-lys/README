Abendempfindung KV 523
======================

This Lied was composed by Mozart in 1787, the great year of Don
Giovanni KV 527 and Eine Kleine Nachtmusick KV 525, but also the year
of Lieder.  Like "Als Luise die Briefe ihres Ungetreuen Liebhabers
verbrannte" KV 520, this lied is a masterpiece which prepares the
ground to Schubert's great songs.  It is the longest lied Mozart ever
composed (110 bars and a running time of about 5 minutes), and the
verses well represent one of the peculiar aspects of Mozart's
personality: that self-possessed sorrow which is found so often in his
works, even the most joyful ones.
