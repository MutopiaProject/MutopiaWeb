Als Luise die Briefe ihres Ungetreuen Liebhabers verbrannte KV 520
(When Luise Burned The Letters Of Her Unfaithful Lover)
==================================================================

This Lied was composed by Mozart in 1787, the year of Don Giovanni and
Eine Kleine Nachtmusick, but also the great year of Lieder.  This one,
despite the poor quality of the text, is one of the best in his whole
production.  There is a deep dramatization of the events described in
the verses: melismas are banned, and the fast thirteenth notes in the
piano part well depicts the fire where Luise is burning her letters.
