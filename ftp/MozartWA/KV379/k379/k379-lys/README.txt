Violin Sonata in G Major K 379
==============================

This edition is a reproduction of an old XIX-century edition.  The
reproduction is as faithful as possible: however, I chose to remove pedal
markings because of reasons stated below.

I compared this old edition with the Neue Mozart Ausgabe (NMA), which is
considered to be the "reference" edition and closely follows the autograph.
The present edition shows significant discrepances from the NMA in slurs,
dynamics and articulations in general. For instance, while Mozart used
distinctly dots and strokes above noteheads to indicate staccato and
spiccato, in the present edition all Mozart's strokes are changed into dots
(e.g. Violin, bar 67 in the Allegro have strokes above the last three G, and
the same for the following similar bars).  The unknown editor chose to
extensively use pedal markings, which I chose not to reproduce in this
edition, considering that Mozart never notated them explicitly in his
autographs and therefore we cannot know exactly how he used the pedal
(however, we do know that he enjoyed a lot using it!).

An interesting article about the composition of this beautiful violin sonata
was written by Dennis Pajot and published on the MozartForum
