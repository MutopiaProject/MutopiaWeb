Fugue fragment in G Major Anhang 41 (KV 375g)
=============================================

The source text used in the preparation of this score is a photography
of the autograph reproduced in the booklet of the CD "Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart - Fragments and Unfinished Works for Piano" by Duo Crommelynck
(Claves Records, CD 50-9109).  This fugue was probably begun in
1776-77.

The autograph was reproduced as faithfully as possible, except for some
minor instances:

1. The upper staff in the autograph uses a soprano clef, which is not
   common practice today.  It has been therefore substituted with a
   soprano clef.

2. A lot of switches between the upper and lower staff occur in the
   third voice.  In this reproduction of the score, the first two
   voices are written in the upper staff, while the others are always
   placed in the second staff.

3. Mozart did not write full bar rests, preferring to leave the bar
   blank.  In this edition, full bar rests are always written.
