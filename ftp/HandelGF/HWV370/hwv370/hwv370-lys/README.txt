Sonata for Violin and Piano HWV 370
==============================

This edition is a subset from "Peters Edition, 1917 - Editor: Hans Sitt (1850-1922)".

It' is a subset because i leave out a lot of articulations, slurs and dynamics. The original arranged violin-part does not match the general taste today, because a lot of entries are definite not from Haendel. So i decided to remove nearly all articulations, slurs and dynamics. 
I also remove the octaves in the left hand from the piano-part due to the same reasons.
Now this edition is a good base for teaching, enter own ideas and varied interpretations.

I didn't add anything to the old source to avoid trouble with current copyrighted editions.
