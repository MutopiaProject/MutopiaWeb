Thus saith the Lord, the Lord of Hosts;
Yet once a lit -- tle while;
and I will shake __ the heav'ns and the earth, the sea and the dry land,
and I will shake __ and I will shake __ all na -- tions;
I'll shake the heav'ns, the earth, the sea, the dry lands, all na -- tions, I'll shake,
and the de -- sire __ of all na -- tions shall come.
The Lord whom ya seek, shall sud -- den -- ly come to his tem -- ple;
ev'n the mes -- sen -- ger of the Co -- ve -- nant,
whom ye de -- light in, be -- hold he shall come,
saith the Lord of Hosts.
