%{ 
These files were done during the month of June, 2004.
The notes are input in other formats first then converted,
first from nwc to mid then to ly.
Then touch ups have to be added.
I did all these so they can be printed out nicely,
to be played during the 40th aniversary for my church I'm in, Jesus Saves Mission.
Like Bach said, "For the Greater Glory of God", I hope I give all glory to God too.
Thank God that I can play this great piece of music,
and for giving me this opporunity I can share with others what I have.
